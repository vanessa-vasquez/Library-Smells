# <p align="center"> Library Smells </p>

This is a funny web app meant to track the different smells at CU libraries. You can access it [here](https://cu-library-smells.herokuapp.com/). <br>
This project was built using React, Bootstrap, SightEngine Text Moderation API, and Firebase.

## set-up
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Since this project uses Firebase and the SightEngine Text Moderation API, you will need to add these credentials to a .env file. Make sure to add your .env file to your .gitignore file as well. 
3. Once you have set up your credentials, run a local development server: `npm start`.
